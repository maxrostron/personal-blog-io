One thing I've noticed, and loved, in the "Indie Hacker" sphere is the growth of <a href="https://openstartup.tm" className="utility__sidenote-contents-link">
"Open Startups"</a> and "Building in Public". Companies and founders share data around growth or revenue and stories about their successes and failures.

<br />

The belief is that radical transparency in this format is a great way to gain exposure, build trust, test new ideas and be held accountable.

<br />

As I currently don't have a manager, or a company, ensuring I hit 'personal development targets' this is my way of setting intentions publically, being held accountable, and being honest about my successes and failures. This is also a great chance to learn about scraping other services for data and integrating into their APIs.

<br />

Pieter Levels popularised the idea whilst launching <a href="https://levels.io/hoodmaps/" className="utility__sidenote-contents-link"> "Hoodmaps" </a> .<a href="https://stephsmith.io/open" className="utility__sidenote-contents-link"> Steph Smith </a> and <a href="https://nesslabs.com/annual-review-2019" className="utility__sidenote-contents-link"> Anne-Laure Le Cunff</a> are two other great examples of what it means to build and live openly.
