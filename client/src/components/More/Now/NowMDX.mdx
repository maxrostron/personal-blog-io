### Pivoting

In February 2021, I decided to make a career pivot away from my speciality as an Innovation & Strategy Consultant at Pollen8 and Accenture for a variety of reasons. Since, I've embarked on a creative sabbatical to learn a new skill - web development.

<br />

I'm self-teaching this using the fantastic, free and open-source course created by the guys over at <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/"> The Odin Project </a>. I've recently completed their full-stack javascript curriculum, and I feel pretty confident in building MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack web apps now! It's super satisfying.

<br />
<br />

### Pondering

I'm not sure what I want to build or learn next. I have an extremely hungry curiosity, so I kind of want to do everything. I'll probably get familiar with Typescript, SQL and using geospatial/ mapping pacakages. Over the medium term, I'll definitely explore javascript based machine learning, big data and IoT technologies.

<br />

The other big question on my mind is finding a way to monetise this new found passion. Freelance? Pick up some innovaiton consulting work? Build a simple web app and sell it? Work for a company again? I'm extremely open minded to all opportunities. It's great having so many options, and I'm excited to find out which path I'll end up taking.

<br />
<br />

### Building

In the short term, I'm focused on getting this website to roughly where I want it. It's great practice to put what I've learnt into action. I also really want to develop some more content for the site.

<br />

Beyond coding, I'm building a book of my favourite ever cooking recipes! I've been vegetarian/ vegan for 25 years now and would like to log some of the best things I've made. Keep an eye out for my quarter-century veg project!

<br />

### Consuming

I've been moving away from non-fiction reading this past year as most books in this category could be summed up in a short essay. It's also really tiring. So I repicked up Shantaram after 3 years and finally push through to the finish! A beautifully written and poetic book which really makes you crave a proper curry. I'm now reading the sequel - Mountain Shadow.

<br />

I haven't watched many new TV shows or Movies this year, but Charley and I have been binging all nine seasons of the classic 'One Tree Hill'. The simplicity is relaxing, and the storyline surprisingly gripping!

<br />
<br />

### Living

As with most people during the pandemic, Charley and I spent a lot of 2021 debating whether we would partake in the great migration and escape London for a life working remotely in the countryside with more space than our one-bed, loud flat could offer.

<br />

We decided against it. At the moment we are too young to squirrel away in a cottage tending vegetables, and really want to make the most of the life, opportunity and energy London gives us. So to give things a shake up, we moved to a more sustainable and spacious flat in Primrose Hill. Let's see where we are in two years time!
